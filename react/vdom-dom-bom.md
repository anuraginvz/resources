Excellent question! Let’s break this down **clearly and visually**.

You’re asking about **how these 5 concepts differ**, **when they are created**, **how they interact**, and **when they are destroyed**.

---

## 🔄 1. **Virtual DOM (VDOM)**

### ✅ What is it?

A **lightweight in-memory tree of JavaScript objects** representing the structure of the UI.

### 🔨 When is it created?

* Every time your component **renders** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.), React **creates a new VDOM**.

### 💥 When is it destroyed?

* When a component **unmounts** or **re-renders**, the previous VDOM for that component becomes stale and is discarded (or kept temporarily for diffing as the "old VDOM").

---

## 🔁 2. **Old Virtual DOM**

### ✅ What is it?

The **previous render's** virtual DOM — used during **diffing** to compare against the new one.

### 🔨 When is it created?

* It’s the result of the **previous render cycle**.
* React **keeps a copy** (e.g. `fiber.alternate`) to compare.

### 💥 When is it destroyed?

* After React commits the changes to the real DOM, the old VDOM may be discarded or replaced with the new one (depends on memory optimizations).

---

## 🆕 3. **New Virtual DOM**

### ✅ What is it?

The **VDOM React generates** during the current render.

### 🔨 When is it created?

* Every time the component renders (e.g. `setState()` or `props` change).
* This is the version React will **compare to the old one** during **reconciliation**.

### 💥 When is it destroyed?

* It becomes the **old VDOM** on the next render, or is discarded if the component is unmounted.

---

## 🏗️ 4. **Real DOM (Browser DOM)**

### ✅ What is it?

The **actual DOM tree** rendered in the browser — what you see in the browser DevTools.

### 🔨 When is it created?

* Initially by React using `document.createElement()` or via hydration if SSR.
* Updated only during the **commit phase** of the render cycle — and only for parts that changed.

### 💥 When is it destroyed?

* On page reload or if the element/component is unmounted.

## 🌐 5. **Browser Object Model (BOM)**

### ✅ What is it?

The **browser’s API for interacting with the browser environment**, including:

| Part of BOM | Examples                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Window      | `window.open()`, `window.innerWidth` |
| Navigator   | `navigator.userAgent`                |
| Screen      | `screen.width`                       |
| Location    | `location.href`                      |
| History     | `history.pushState()`                |

### 🔨 When is it created?

* Created automatically by the browser **when the page loads**.

### 💥 When is it destroyed?

* On **full page reload** or browser tab close.

| Concept             | What it is                           | Created when                           | Destroyed when                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Virtual DOM**     | In-memory JS tree of UI              | On each render                         | After diff or component unmount |
| **Old Virtual DOM** | Previous VDOM copy for diffing       | Automatically stored during render     | After diff/commit               |
| **New Virtual DOM** | Newly generated tree from render     | On each render                         | Becomes old VDOM or discarded   |
| **Real DOM**        | Actual DOM shown in browser          | First mount, and updates during commit | On unmount or full reload       |
| **BOM**             | Browser APIs (window, history, etc.) | When browser/tab opens                 | On tab close or reload          |
